## Tutorial aims 

1. Understand the fundamentals of time series analysis and its applications in environmental data.
2. Learn how to preprocess, visualize, and decompose time series datasets for meaningful insights.
3. Gain hands-on experience with forecasting techniques to predict trends in environmental data.
4. Develop skills in using R and relevant packages for analyzing time series data effectively.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
